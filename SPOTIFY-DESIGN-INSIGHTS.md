During this project I have learned some new concepts and methodologies to handle different situations.

In design stage, one of the challenges was to create dynamic gradient color based on the image of an artist or an album. After some research I found there are some libraries created for this. At the end I selected 'node-vibrant' library. 

To create error boundaries I have created parallel routes. By this way I achieved a separate parallel routes in a single page, so any error or loading state will not affect the other one. 

For data I used spotify web api which helped me to use real data instead of hardcoding. 

I have added static and dynamic generated metadata objects to different pages. 

I have implemented light/dark theme as well and researched about how to do it in tailwind and how to add smooth transitions for theme changes. 

In general this project helped me a lot with creating responsive designs, implementing themes and handling errors&loading states in the project.
